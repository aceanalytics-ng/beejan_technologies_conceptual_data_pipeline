# Beejan Technologies Customer Complaint Conceptual Data Pipeline
### By: Ayobami Yusuf
### Summary
This document outlines the conceptual data pipeline I designed for an end-to-end data pipeline that will consolidate customer complaint data from multiple sources at Beejan Technologies. The proposed architecture addresses the current challenges of data silos, manual reporting processes, and delayed insights by implementing a unified, automated pipeline that can handle both real-time and batch data processing.

### 1. Source Identification & Ingestion Strategy
#### Data Sources Identified:
*	Social Media: Twitter, Facebook complaints (streaming data, high volume, unstructured text) 
*	Call Center Logs: Daily CSV/XML exports from call management system (batch, semi-structured)
*	SMS Complaints: Customer text messages via shortcode (near real-time, structured)
*	Website Forms: Online complaint submissions (real-time, structured JSON)

#### Ingestion Approach: 
The pipeline employs a hybrid (Lambda) ingestion strategy to accommodate different data velocities and formats. Real-time sources like social media and web forms connect through API gateways for immediate processing, while call center logs use scheduled file transfers. SMS data feeds through a near real-time processor to balance timeliness with system stability.

#### Key Assumption: 
Social media data will require third-party API access, and I'm assuming we can establish proper authentication and rate limiting agreements with these platforms.

### 2. Processing & Transformation Strategy
#### Data Cleansing & Standardization: The processing layer implements a four-stage approach:
1.	Validation: Check for completeness, format consistency, and data integrity
2.	Standardization: Convert all text to consistent encoding, normalize date formats, and establish common field structures
3.	Enrichment: Add metadata like source channel, timestamp, customer segment information
4.	Classification: Automated categorization using rule-based logic and pattern matching to classify complaints into predefined categories (network issues, billing problems, service quality, etc.)

#### My Thought Process: 
Rather than trying to implement any complex machine learning or predictive analytics at this stage, I'm proposing a rule-based classification system that can be easily maintained and understood by business users. This can evolve into more sophisticated approaches later.


### 3. Storage Architecture
#### Multi-tier Storage Approach:
*	Data Lake: Store all raw, unprocessed data for historical analysis and regulatory compliance. This provides flexibility for future analytics needs we might not anticipate today.
*	Data Warehouse: To store cleaned, structured data optimized for business intelligence and reporting queries
*	Operational Store: Fast-access storage for real-time dashboards and alert systems

#### Storage Format Strategy: 
Raw data stored in its original format initially, then we convert them to a columnar format (like Parquet) in the warehouse for efficient querying. JSON format maintained for semi-structured data that might need flexible schema evolution.

#### Challenge Identified: 
Determining optimal data retention policies will require understanding regulatory requirements and business needs for historical analysis. I might need to do some extensive stakeholder engagement at this point (and it appears time is of the essence â€“ no Tems pun intended)

### 4. Serving & Analytics Layer
#### Multi-channel Data Access:
*	Analytics Dashboards: Executive and operational dashboards showing complaint trends, resolution times, and performance metrics
*	Reporting APIs: Automated report generation for different business units
*	Alert System: Real-time notifications for high-severity issues or unusual complaint patterns
*	Predictive Models: Future capability for forecasting complaint volumes and identifying at-risk customers

#### User Experience Consideration: 
Different user groups need different levels of detail. Executives want high-level trends, while operational teams need granular, actionable data.

### Design Challenges & Unknowns
1.	Data Volume Estimation: Without knowing exact complaint volumes, sizing the infrastructure appropriately will require careful monitoring and iterative scaling.
2.	Social media: Obtaining reliable, cost-effective access to social media APIs might present commercial and technical challenges.
3.	Classification Accuracy: The effectiveness of automated complaint categorization will need continuous refinement based on business feedback.
4.	Integration Complexity: Connecting to existing systems (especially legacy call center software) may require custom development work or at least collaboration with our in-house developer(s).
5.	Data Privacy: Ensuring customer data protection throughout the pipeline, especially with cross-border data flows, will require careful compliance planning.
